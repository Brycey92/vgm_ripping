ea_multi_xma 0.2 unpacks the variable-packet-size, multi-stream XMA and XMA2 streams common in EA games for the Xbox 360. It replaces unpack1943 which only worked on single-stream files. Supports Battlefield 1943, Battlefield: Bad Company, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, and Dante's Inferno, possibly others. For Dante's Inferno files, use "-o 20" on the command line to ignore the first 32 (0x20) bytes (a few files used a different offset, in all cases the offset is specified in the header at 0xC).
