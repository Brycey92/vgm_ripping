OggS Rain on Brooklyn
by hcs

Extracts/rebuilds Ogg streams from the .mediastream_s files in
Watchmen: The End is Nigh.

Note that these streams are not quite correct: I use the granule from
the original stream, which specified the first sample of the page, not the
last. As far as I can tell this doesn't matter to the decoder.

CRC code from Xiph.org's Tremor lowmem branch.
