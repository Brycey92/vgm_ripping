SSM Extractor v0.1
by hcs

This is a command line tool for exporting the sounds within an SSM archive into individual DSP files.

Caveat:
I currently do not have a single working algorithm for calculating the offset of the ADPCM data, rather
I have two, which together agree on much of the data, and where they disagree usually one is right (as
can be tested with consistency checks against the header). I generate a "confidence" value for every
track extracted, if it is too low (which only happens when neither method seems to point to the proper
data) it will not extract the data. Hopefully I'll be able to find something that works soon, but this
works acceptably on nearly everything (in Smash Bros. Melee) at the moment.
