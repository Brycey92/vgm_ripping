vexxsound - Dump music files from Vexx (GC) sound0.tre

First the top level supertree0.tre needs to be extracted with the BMS script by
aluigi <https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=4513#p38695>.  I've modified
this (vexx_supertree.bms) to use the newer QuickBMS SortArray function.

Filenames are not actually present in the .tre directory index, instead there is
a file name hash. The top level names are found in a file called tempfiles.txt
within supertree0.tre (sorted by offset within the supertree file, though the
index is sorted by name hash), but there is no equivalent (AFAIK) for
VexxDataGC_TreFiles\Data\Sound\sound0.tre.

In any case the files within sound0.tre are just named with numbers like
data\sound\0000001.dsp. sound3.ad3 gives higher level names to these.

vexxsound (as committed here) uses sound.ad3 to find the numbers and names of
the streams in the Music group, looks them up by hash, uses the names
for the dumped .dsp files.
Run like this, with sound0.tre and sound.ad3 in the same directory:

vexxsound sound0.tre

This won't produce a finished rip, as there are no loops and some tracks are
split into chunks.  There are also .mdf metadata files for each .dsp, and the
other sound.* files might have information that can be used to make TXTP
playlists.
