Decrypt some files. Don't remember what game this was from, but at a guess I
think it may have been Fallen Earth. The decryption key is
"Icarus_Studios_WinterWolf_Engine=CB,JH,MN,JB,JD,AL,RO"
and I think those may be initials; Chris Babcock was Lead 3D Engine Programmer
on Fallen Earth, though I can't match up all the others to members of the team.
