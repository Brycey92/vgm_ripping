strip_silence 0.1 removes silence at the end of .wav files, and prints a command to re-add the silence (with the included add_silence). It's intended for use with 44100 Hz 16-bit stereo PCM files, such as CD Audio. A nice feature is that it leaves a little silence at the end (1 second by default). This can be used to strip trailing silence from odd files, but retain the ability to re-add it and get the original file back.
