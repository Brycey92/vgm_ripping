strip_wav 0.1 is useful in some situations where strip_silence isn't, such as when the silence at the end of the file isn't entirely zeroes. It strips a number of bytes from the end of a .wav, by default 10 seconds worth of 44100 Hz 16-bit stereo PCM, regardless of whether they are perfectly silent. It also prints a command to restore the file; if the stripped bytes were all zero the command is add_silence (included), otherwise it backs up the original file and prints a copy command.
