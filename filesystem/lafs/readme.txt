lafs - AFS extraction

Tired of using other AFS extractors that don't always work, and
that don't have source, hcs has written his own.
Missing a lot of features (as mentioned in the source) but
seemingly functional.

0.0 - 1/3/08 - first release
0.1 - 10/7/08 - rename duplicate files, support AFS with no name table
0.2 - 10/12/08 - add another way to find the name table
0.3 - 8/27/10 - support directories in file names, create a base directory
