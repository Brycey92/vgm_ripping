2009-10-26 - lzh8_dec00 (0.0)
             Initial reverse engineering of decompressor from
             "Uncharted Waters: New Horizons" wad

2009-10-27 - lzh8_ed-proto0
             dec: Some cleanup of table reading, debug output for
                  frequencies, symbols, and tree
             enc: Initial (incomplete) compression implementation,
                  LZSS and Huffman tree building only.

2009-10-28 - lzh8_cmpdec01 (0.1)
             dec: More cleanup of table reading, more debug output for tree
             cmp: First working compression implementation, sequential LZSS
                  search and breadth-first traversal for Huffman tree table
                  building.

2009-10-29 - lzh8_cmpdec02 (0.2)
             dec: Debug output for table
             cmp: - Hashing for fast LZSS search
                  - 32-bit aligned output (removed earlier padding impl)
                  - Debug output for tree

           - lzh8_cmpdec03 (0.3)
             cmp: Provide nonstrict compression build

           - lzh8_cmpdec04 (0.4)
             dec: Fix table overread

2009-11-01 - lzh8_cmpdec05 (0.5)
             cmp: - Correct table building algorithm
                  - Comment, name, code cleanup

           - lzh8_cmpdec06 (0.6)
             Makefile support for nonstrict compressor
             cmp: Fix memory leak

2009-11-02 - lzh8_cmpdec07 (0.7)
             History, general comment and code cleanup
             cmp: - Support for building Huffman codes for 1 symbol
                  - Safely handle 0 symbols (no backreferences, empty file)
                  - Safely handle empty files
                  - Fix potential overrun of table control buffer.

2009-11-02 - lzh8_cmpdec08 (0.8)
             dec: Stop when decode table is full
